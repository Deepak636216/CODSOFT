## Features

- **Add Student**: Enter and save student details including name, age, and registration ID.
- **Update Student**: Modify existing student details using the registration ID.
- **Delete Student**: Remove a student record from the system.
- **Search Student**: Find and display a studentâ€™s details using the registration ID.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Tools and Libraries**: Java Swing for GUI,postgreSql for database 

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deepak636216/CodSoft.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `src` folder, compile, and run the main Java files:
   ```bash
   cd CodSoft/src
   javac StudentRegistration.java
   java StudentRegistration
   ```
